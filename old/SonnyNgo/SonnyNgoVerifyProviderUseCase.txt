Use Case: Verify provider
Context: A ChocAn manager needs to verify the status of a provider's membership before authorizing payment for services rendered by the provider.
Actors: Manager, Provider
Main Success Scenario:
1. The manager requests the provider's member number and enters it into the ChocAn system.
2. The system confirms the provider's membership status.
3. If the provider's membership is valid, the manager authorizes payment for services rendered by the provider.
4. If the provider's membership is not valid, the manager informs the provider and does not authorize payment for services rendered.
Extensions:
2a. If the system cannot confirm the provider's membership status, the manager requests additional information from the provider and verifies their identity.
2b. If the provider's membership has expired, the manager informs the provider and does not authorize payment for services rendered until the membership is renewed.
