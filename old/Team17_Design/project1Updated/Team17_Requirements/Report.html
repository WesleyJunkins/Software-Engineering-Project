	<h1>Short Paragraph</h1>
	<p>Chocoholics Anonymous, or “ChocAn,” is a company dedicated to helping people overcome addiction to chocolate. Members have access to a plethora of services including dieting consultation, personal trainers, and much more. Our software will be able to complete all processes necessary to a comfortable customer and healthcare provider experience. The sole 4 actors include healthcare providers, managers, operators, and a timer. From the central terminal, providers will be able to check in customers by scanning their member card and then logging service details to the company Data Center. This report requires a service code, which may be accessed in the Provider Directory pop-up. Upon completing this report, providers may scan the member card again to bill the company. Every Friday at midnight, the timer runs the Main Accounting Procedure through the third party ACME Accounting services. Additionally, it compiles all the transaction information for the week and sends out summary member, provider, manager, and EFT reports to all members, providers, and managers. Managers can also request these reports at any time.  Member and provider profiles may be managed only by software operators. This project will be coded in Java and will take an estimated 3 months to complete by our team of 6 members: Dylan Iovino, Wesley Junkins, Sonny Ngo, Nicholas Seidl, Campbell Thompson, and Sam Wood. For Project 1, we created a glossary of terms necessary to use our software, as well as a Use Case Diagram and Use Case Descriptions for our initial design. For Project 2, we created activity diagrams for each of those use cases, one main activity diagram for the entire system, and a stereotyped class diagram.
