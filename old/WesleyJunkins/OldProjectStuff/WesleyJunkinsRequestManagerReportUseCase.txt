Use Case: Request Manager Report
Context: Any time during the week, a ChocAn manager may request that a number of reports be run.
         The report lists every provider to be paid that week, the number of consultations each 
         had, and his or her total fee for that week. 
         Finally, the total number of providers who provided services, the total number of consultations, 
         and the overall fee total are printed.
